# radbelt: An Astropy-friendly wrapper for the AE-8/AP-8 Van Allen belt model

This is small Python library to model the fluxes of charged particles trapped
in the Van Allen belt. It provides a fast, simple, and convenient Python
interface to the [International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF)] model and
NASA's AE-8/AP-8 models of electron and proton fluxes, which are both
implemented in Fortran. The package is integrated with the [Astropy] ecosystem
for easy conversion of coordinate systems, time scales, and units. With this
package, it is easy and fast to determine the flux of particles above any given
energy, at any position, at any time.

## To install

    $ pip install .

## Example

```pycon
>>> from radbelt import get_flux
>>> from astropy import units as u
>>> from astropy.coordinates import EarthLocation
>>> from astropy.time import Time
>>> coords = EarthLocation(-45 * u.deg, -30 * u.deg, 500 * u.km)
>>> time = Time('2021-03-01')
>>> energy = 20 * u.MeV
>>> get_flux(coords, time, energy, 'p', 'max')  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
<Quantity 2642.50268555 1 / (s cm2)>
```

## Known issues

* The CCMC IGRF code has spatially varying errors of a few percent, which will
  result in a striped pattern in the resulting particle flux.
* This package does not support Windows yet. If you are a Windows developer,
  then please help us out by contributing a pull request! Meanwhile, if you
  need to use this package on Windows, then we recommend using Python under
  Linux within Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), Docker, or a virtual machine.
